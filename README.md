- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kart98ch
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and game development/programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# for Unity, I have always been interested in games programming but never found enough time to learn, so am trying to learn now - starting with basics and moving up from there.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me to learn more on programming in Unity and soon C++ in Unreal.
- 📫 Please email me at kartik98ch@gmail.com if you need to reach out me about anything.

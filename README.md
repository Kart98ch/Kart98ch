- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kart98ch. I have a Mathematics Bachelors and Masters, and am currently working as a consultant; however, I want to pivot to the games industry and am thus teaching myself in my spare time. I can code in Python, MATLAB, VBA and am currently learning how to code in C# - with aspirations to also learn C++.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a self-taught in machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ with a focus on Unreal Engine - currently enrolled and learning this with CGSpectrum.
- ðŸ“« Please email me at kartik98ch@gmail.com if you need to reach out me about anything.
